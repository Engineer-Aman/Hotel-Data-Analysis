In this project I analyse the hotel data to find some insight that will help hotel business to improve.
I took data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).
Also I attached file in this repository you can download it by quick link here.

[hotel_bookings 2.csv](https://github.com/Engineer-Aman/Hotel-Data-Analysis/files/11010542/hotel_bookings.2.csv)

## Business Problem 
Questions:
1. what are the variables that affect hotels resrvations cancellations? 
2. how can we make hotels reservations cancelled better? 
3. how will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotonal decisions?

## Analysis Of Data

```ruby
cancelled=df['is_canceled'].value_counts(normalize=True)
print(cancelled)

plt.figure(figsize=(5,4))
plt.title("Reservation Status")
plt.bar(['Not Cancled','Cancled'],df['is_canceled'].value_counts(),color=['cyan','Yellow',])

```

The bar graph shows the count of reservations that are canceled and those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of reservations that have not been canceled. There are more than 37% of clients who canceled their reservation, which have a significant impact on the hotels earnings.

```ruby
plt.figure(figsize=(11,4))
axis1=sns.countplot(x='hotel',hue='is_canceled',data=df,palette='Blues')
legend_labels,_=axis1.get_legend_handles_labels()

plt.title("Reservation Status In Hotels",size=20)
plt.xlabel("hotel",size=14)
plt.ylabel("number of reservations",size=14)
plt.show()

```

In above chart we can see that in comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. Itâ€™s possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in city hotels. Also we can see that reservation cancelation is more in city hotels it's more than 50% compare to resort hotel.
